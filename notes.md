https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQUID

The serious, like DARPA funded, pros use SQUIDs  (superconducting quantum interference devices), which use Josephson junctions to measure the incredible tiny fields generated by currents in your brain. 

The consumer grade things are low-cost EEGs as everyone else has said, but as Lemonie has alluded, there are research teams working with DIRECT neural stimulation, with electrode matrices fabricated in silicon and other materials. The direct stuff is for prosthetic limb operation, and optic nerves stimulation. The optic stuff is amazingly advanced already.


Hi there
You have three options: OpenEEG (a bit of a project but not too hard, not cheap), commercial headset EMOTIV (not too good signal quality for the very high price) or Arduino/Mindflex combination.
If you want to buy the OpenEEG I can make an instructable for you, since I have a 6 channel device myself and it can use a little tune up anyways. 
If you want to go ahead and play, I recommend the Mindflex.

EEG is more that a diagnostic medical tool, it's also used in a many branches of scientific research like cognitive psychology of neuroscience. When using it for control or gaming, you could use one of several methods:
- just use alpha wave band power which correlates somehow with relaxation (as it is the so called 'idle rhythm', probably inhibiting the corresponding cortical areas)
- use simple thresholds in band power over the motor areas (high beta values (mu rhythm) on each side of the head correspond to imagined movement on the contralateral side of the body), you need 2 channels for that, but you also get 2 'directions' of decision making
- use more complicated machine learning stuff, not that hard anymore if you have the proper development tools but still something more advanced


This is still very much an advanced project.  Most projects working with thought-based human interface are still in their early infancy right now.  

That said, there are two key ingredients at the heart it all:

1.  EEG readings, or any other reading of the activity of the brain.  These can be simplified or very complex, and which method is used depends on the nature of the project.  The popular Force Trainer toy just monitors the overall level of activity, getting an idea of whether you are concentrating or relaxing, and nothing more.

2.  Training.  Many of the very simple uses (Force Trainer) will only require a few minutes of practice, but a complicated system of commands requires training both the device and the user.  Complex systems could easily take months to master.

Ok, your first stops should be:
http://openeeg.sourceforge.net/doc/  - Open EEG project.  It may be full of new-agey pseudoscience, but it does have a lot of good ideas and resources on how to build an EEG machine of your own.

http://pceeg.sourceforge.net/ - An arduino-based EEG project. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_consumer_brain-computer_interface_devices  - A brief round-up of some consumer devices.  I highly suggest you click around and see what each can do and how it's being done.

Regarding availability of OpenBCI kits in London

Imara Speek - 

"No, but there's a biohacker meetup every week in the makerspace in London. If you try and get into contact with them, a lot of people there have some kits available and they're always open to introducing others.

Good luck!"

ML is stuck on asking why... would BCI be useful in correcting doubts

- A pioneer of machine learning predicts that we'll know AI is capable of committing evil when "it is obvious to us that there are software components that the robot ignores, consistently ignores. When it appears that the robot follows the advice of some software components and not others..." -
